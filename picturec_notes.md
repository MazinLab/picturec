Still to do:
  - Order/configure switches to use them with the PICTURE-C electronics rack.
    - Determine how we want to control the power.
    - Figure out how we want to account for instruments being off in the software side of things.

  - For systemd unit files, decide how to most smartly run python scripts

Notes about creating ***udev*** rules for picturec devices
    - The ArduinoUNO (currentduino) and ArduinoMEGA (hemttempAgent) udev rules are based on the
        serial numbers from the devices themselves.
    - The SIM921 and SIM960 (AC Resistance Bridge / PID Controller) use RS232-to-USB converters
        so their udev rules are based on the FTDI chips in the USB-to-RS232 cable.
        - Each cable will be labelled with the device it goes to to avoid confusion.

How to properly configure the driver for the LakeShore240 USB!!
    - Explanation as to why this matters : as of 14 October 2020, the LakeShore 240 Temperature Monitor is the only
        Lake Shore product that is NOT supported natively by Linux
    - Not to worry! We can slightly modify the driver module and make everything alright (see this post for a good intro
        of what we will be doing https://www.silabs.com/community/interface/forum.topic.html/linux_cannot_identif-PB7r)
    - First, from this link (https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
        you can download driver source code so you can manually add it in.
    - Next, from the zipped directory you download, unzip into a directory (currently this is
        'picturec/hardware/drivers/lakeshoredriver') where you will find a file called cp210x.c
    - In 'cp210x.c' add the VID/PID of the LS240 (1FB9, 0205) to the list like below
        { USB_DEVICE(0x1FB9, 0x0201) }, /* Lake Shore Model 219 Temperature Monitor */
        { USB_DEVICE(0x1FB9, 0x0202) }, /* Lake Shore Model 233 Temperature Transmitter */
        { USB_DEVICE(0x1FB9, 0x0203) }, /* Lake Shore Model 235 Temperature Transmitter */
    --> { USB_DEVICE(0x1FB9, 0x0205) }, /* Lake Shore Model 240 Temperature Monitor */
        { USB_DEVICE(0x1FB9, 0x0300) }, /* Lake Shore Model 335 Temperature Controller */
    - Once this is done, you need to copy this file to where the kernel modules exist on your machine.
        Note, this may require sudo/write permissions to the directory
        - For Ubuntu 20.04, Linux kernel 5.3.0-59-generic, this is in '/lib/modules/5.3.0-59-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/serial'
               (to find your active kernel, just type 'uname -r' into the command line)
        - Alternatively, you can copy the file to '/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial
    - Now, if you are NOT using secure boot, edit '/etc/modules' to contain 1 line that says 'cp210x'.
    - If you ARE using secure boot, still edit '/etc/modules' to contain the line 'cp210x', but we also need to manually
        sign the files (essentially signing off that they're trusted)
        - See the following link for instructions : https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-to-sign-things-for-secure-boot
        - Create a file called openssl.cnf
            - In the file paste the following:
                # This definition stops the following lines choking if HOME isn't
                # defined.
                HOME                    = .
                RANDFILE                = $ENV::HOME/.rnd
                [ req ]
                distinguished_name      = req_distinguished_name
                x509_extensions         = v3
                string_mask             = utf8only

                [ req_distinguished_name ]
                commonName              = Secure Boot Signing

                [ v3 ]
                subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
                authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer
                basicConstraints        = critical,CA:FALSE
                extendedKeyUsage        = codeSigning,1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.6,1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.16.1.2
                nsComment               = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
        - Once created run from the command line
            - 'openssl req -config ./openssl.cnf -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 36500 -outform DER -keyout "MOK.priv" -out "MOK.der"'
            - Note that -keyout and -out specify the paths to the private and public keys that you will need (.priv and .der)
        - Once completed, run 'sudo mokutil --import MOK.der'
            - This will prompt a password for when you enroll the key.
        - After making a password (keep it simple, you only need it once, it's temporary) reboot the computer.
        - While rebooting, it will take you to a blue screen that says MokManager, follow the prompts to 'Enroll MOK'
        - After following the prompts, it will reboot again and start the computer up
            - With the computer started, run 'sudo cat /proc/keys' and make sure there is one that has the same commonName as you entered.
        - Now you can sign files!
            - To sign the specific module we need, run the following
                'sudo kmodsign sha512 /path/to/MOK.priv /path/to/MOK.der /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.c'
        - At this point, you should be able to connect to the LakeShore240 via serial, even with secure boot on and
            without manually starting the module.
        - NOTE : If the module is not started up immediately after signing it, you can either reboot (make sure it's in
            the '/etc/modules' file) or run 'sudo modprobe cp210x', which will load it without rebooting
